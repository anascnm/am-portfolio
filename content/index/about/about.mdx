My name is Anastasia and I am a 26 year old self taught devloper passionate about designing and developing user-friendly websites. 

I have all the skills to create a new high quality website or improve existing websites, using the latest techniques and trends. 

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or hiking.
